music_rearranger.py
===================

Arrange your mp3 music collection into meaningful directories automatically & at scale.
This simple program takes input & output folders as 2 arguments. then for each MP3 file in input folder, it reads the artist & album names, then creates new dir structure consisting of artist/album name in output dir & moves the file. This means your music is stored in meaningful folders, and any number of files can be rearranged at once. 
So go ahead and clean up your music collection
 This program uses eyeD3 version 0.6, you can get eyeD3 from http://eyed3.nicfit.net/
